Organization of the whole repository
------------------------------------

This document explains the directory structure of this repository. For the
whole subversion repository we use the classical approach with three
directories:

trunk/ is the most stable version, used to make releases.

branches/ is for temporary changes such as bug fixes and new features/

tags/ is used for the releases.


Organization of the main project directory
------------------------------------------

At the trunk, we use two sets of directories to organize sources and binaries.
The sources group includes:

docsrc/ sources for the documents, it will become 'doc' after running 'make
install'

src/ sources of Beernet components. Here is the meat. It becomes 'lib' after
running 'make install'

tools/ sources of the command line tools that allow non-oz programmers to use
Beernet. It becomes 'bin' after running 'make install'

The compiled directories are:

doc/ for documentation

lib/ for the compiled Beernet components

bin/ for Beernet tools. 

These three directories are not under versioning control. They just have the
skeleton of the released directories.

And remember that a beer a day keeps the doctor away.
