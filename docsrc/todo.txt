Implementation
===========================================================================

- Refresh Fingers: Explicit to event to trigger a search for best fingers

- New Node Ref: Propagate the change of a new pbeer reference to all
  components having a reference to it. This is part of the design is not so
nice, because the value of the NodeRef is duplicated in every object that
needs it, instead of managing in a single place from which all components
should read. The reason is simply for performance. Ideally, it should be
redesign to avoid state duplication without sacrificing performance. This is a
long task. 

- Make a timer component that can be referenced from all objects that needs
  it, and prevent creating too many threads.

Documentation 
===========================================================================

- Add Trappist components to the architecture diagram. We are implementing
  Beernet-0.8, and the architecture still shows Beernet-0.6

- Document nicely the API
